README for Open-ETickets 

Open-ETickets is a fork of Fusion Ticket. Most of this code is taken from there. Due to
disagreements over the intepretation of the GPL with the current lead dev, I have forked
it and moved to GitHub.

There is NO SUPPORT for this. If you wish to use a supported project, I strongly recommend
you use the original.
